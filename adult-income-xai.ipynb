These are prepared monthly\n| for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau.  We use 3 sets of\n| controls.\n|  These are:\n|          1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.\n|          2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.\n|          3.  Controls by Race, age and sex.\n|\n| We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and \"rake\" through\n| them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used.\n|\n| The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating\n| \"weighted tallies\" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the\n| population.\n|\n| People with similar demographic characteristics should have\n| similar weights.  There is one important caveat to remember\n| about this statement.  That is that since the CPS sample is\n| actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own\n| probability of selection, the statement only applies within\n| state.\n\n\n>50K, <=50K.\n\nage: continuous.\nworkclass: Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.\nfnlwgt: continuous.\neducation: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool.\neducation-num: continuous.\nmarital-status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse.\noccupation: Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces.\nrelationship: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried.\nrace: White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black.\nsex: Female, Male.\ncapital-gain: continuous.\ncapital-loss: continuous.\nhours-per-week: continuous.\nnative-country: United-States, Cambodia, England, Puerto-Rico, Canada, Germany, Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc), India, Japan, Greece, South, China, Cuba, Iran, Honduras, Philippines, Italy, Poland, Jamaica, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, Ireland, France, Dominican-Republic, Laos, Ecuador, Taiwan, Haiti, Columbia, Hungary, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Scotland, Thailand, Yugoslavia, El-Salvador, Trinadad&Tobago, Peru, Hong, Holand-Netherlands.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":"columns = ['age','workclass','fnlwgt','education','education_num','marital_status','occupation','relationship','race','sex','capital_gain','capital_loss','hours_per_week','native_country','income']","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.653824Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.654482Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.659955Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.654449Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.659095Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_test = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/adult-income-dataset/adult.test',names = columns,comment='|')#skiprows = 1\ndf_train = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/adult-income-dataset/adult.data',names = columns)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.661057Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.661380Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.858531Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.661357Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.857465Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_test.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.859569Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.859909Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.887661Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.859875Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-03T15:47:07.886484Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":6,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   age   workclass  fnlwgt      education  education_num       marital_status  \\\n0   25     Private  226802           11th              7        Never-married   \n1   38     Private   89814        HS-grad              9   Married-civ-spouse   \n2   28   Local-gov  336951     Assoc-acdm             12   Married-civ-spouse   \n3   44     Private  160323   Some-college             10   Married-civ-spouse   \n4   18           ?  103497   Some-college             10        Never-married   \n\n           occupation relationship    race      sex  capital_gain  \\\n0   Machine-op-inspct    Own-child   Black     Male             0   \n1     Farming-fishing      Husband   White     Male             0   \n2     Protective-serv      Husband   White     Male             0   \n3   Machine-op-inspct      Husband   Black     Male          7688   \n4                   ?
